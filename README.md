# CV_resume_quarto

This repository uses the .qmd file and other associated files from [Bea Milz's resume repository](https://github.com/beatrizmilz/resume) to create resume or CV by using Quarto. Huge acknowledgement also goes to [Nick Strayer's package](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv). Both repositories are extremely useful for helping us to keep up-to-date with our CVs and resumes in our busy lives.

Please feel free to edit or tweak the .qmd file if wanted to suit your style, and don't forget to acknowledge these repositories if you're using the CV/resume template files.
